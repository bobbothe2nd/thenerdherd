      <p class="subtitle">
        Computers are based on this low-level binary language that consists
        entirely of 1s and 0s.
      </p>

    <h1 class="section-header">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="article-body">
      In computer science, 1s and 0s make up everything you see. Other
      strategies have been tried and are still being developed today such as
      ternary computers. Ternary computers have 3 states and quantum computers
      are some of the most innovative tech to this very day.
    </p>
    <p class="article-body">
      However, this course is only going to cover the current most stable
      technology; binary computing. You may have heard about computers having
      certain amounts of storage, like 2 terabytes or 512 gigabytes. Those are
      counts of how much you can store on you computer.
    </p>
    <h1 class="section-header">Understanding Bytes</h1>
    <p class="article-body">
      Random access memory (RAM) is how much your computer can make use of at
      a time, most computers have 16 or 32 gigabytes. The central processing
      unit (CPU) is what your entire computer runs off, it has storage too.
      Usually no more than 96 megabytes though.
    </p>
    <p class="article-body">
      What does all this mean though? Well, at the core, you computer sees
      everything as a 1 or a 0 as stated earlier. These 1s and 0s are called
      bits - A bit can be either on or off. Bits are stored in groups of 8 on
      the typical computer and those are called bytes which are how much is
      interpreted as a single object on your computer.
    </p>
    <p class="article-body">
      These bytes are the foundation of everything in computers and they look
      something like this: <span class="code">00101100</span>. They may not
      seem like much, but they are what build what you are seeing on your
      device right now even though the website was coded in HTML!
    </p>
    <p class="article-body">
      A kilobyte is only 1024 bytes, whereas a megabyte is a whopping 1048576.
      As you climb the hierarchy, each level is 1024 times the previous one. A
      gigabyte is 1024 megabytes and a terabyte is 1024 gigabytes. Petabytes
      are 1024 terabytes, exabytes have 1024 petabytes, zettabytes are as
      large as 1024 exabytes, and yottabytes are 1208925819614629174706176
      bytes.
    </p>
    <h1 class="section-header">What to Expect</h1>
    <p class="article-body">
      This may be overwhelming at first, but it's not hard to pick up. As you
      go through this Nerd Herd course, you won't even be dealing with
      megabytes of data, let alone a kilobyte. The projects given may be
      complex, but never will you be dealing with something as large as what
      you computer is using. However, in higher level courses such as Python,
      you may be dealing with several megabytes of code.

        Some later courses are advanced and may require understanding of
        boolean algebra, a college-level topic. The basics will be covered but
        for a deeper understanding it is recommended to seek external
        resources.
